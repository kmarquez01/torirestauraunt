# LAFU Restauraunt

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The goal of this creation was to implement web design using Next js features  coupled with HTML and CSS. Doing so will help maintain a responsive design while also increasing the level of interactivity. 

I am currently working on developing this website, so it is under construction. However, as progress is being made the changes will become evident in this repository.
